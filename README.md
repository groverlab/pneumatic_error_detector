# Pneumatic Error Detector

![alt text](error_detector.jpeg)

This Adobe Illustrator file contains the channel design of a "pneumatic error detector" that uses microfluidic valves to calculate parity bits and detect errors in the operation of air-powered equipment.  Instructions for engraving the design into polycarbonate sheets and bonding the device are available in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16500).
